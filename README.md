# Hello, I'm NotLatif ðŸ‘‹

## ðŸš€ Full-stack developer | Bot enthusiast | Random script wizard

I build whatever comes to mind, from web applications to automated bots and utility scripts.

### ðŸ’» Tech Stack
- Languages: C, Python, TypeScript, and others
- Frontend: Svelte and more
- Backend: Whatever gets the job done
- Databases: Yes, those too

### ðŸ”­ What I Do
- Create full-stack web applications that actually **work** and are **usable**
- Develop bots that automate the boring stuff
- Write scripts to solve problems you didn't know you had

### ðŸŒ± Philosophy
Code should be elegant but practical. If it works and doesn't make future-me cry, I'm satisfied. <br />
Websites should have good UX. If they don't, I'm leaving.
